# Instructor comments

 - Very thorough derivative file.
 - Note the ```\text{text here}``` command helps write Roman-font text in math environments easily.
 - In math environments (like align, or equation) you do not need the ```$$``` symbols. Those are used only to enter math mode from within a standard text environment.
 - Don't forget to edit your README file
